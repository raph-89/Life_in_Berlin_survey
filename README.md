# Life_in_Berlin_survey
## module_1-intro

This was a small group project as part of module_1-intro of our Data Analytics course at Spiced Academy.

We were asked to choose a topic and ask multiple questions about it via a **Google Forms** survey.

We then sent the survey to all of our classmates. Once they had all responded, we anaylsed the data. We then presented our findings to the class.
